# Signal CLI Bot Integration - Lessons Learned

## Overview
This document captures lessons learned from implementing Signal CLI bot integration with the modern-stack community dashboard. The implementation went through several iterations and challenges, leading to a robust REST API-based solution.

## Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Signal CLI vs REST API Architecture Decision
**Problem**: Initial approach used signal-cli binary directly, leading to complex process management and reliability issues.

**Solution**: Migrated to bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api Docker container for better stability and easier integration.

**Lessons**:
- REST APIs are more reliable than managing CLI processes directly
- Docker containers provide better isolation and consistency
- HTTP-based communication is easier to debug and monitor

### 2. tRPC Router Integration Missing
**Problem**: "No procedure found on path 'signal.registerPhoneNumber'" error on frontend.

**Root Cause**: Signal router wasn't integrated into main tRPC router at `/Users/sac/Git/chat-based-community-dashboard/modern-stack/src/lib/trpc/root.ts`

**Solution**: Added missing imports and router integration:
```typescript
import { signalRouter } from './routers/signal';
// ...
export const appRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  // ...
  signal: signalRouter,
});
```

**Lessons**:
- Always check that new routers are properly integrated
- Frontend errors about missing procedures often indicate missing router registration
- Test end-to-end integration after adding new tRPC procedures

### 3. Missing tRPC Procedures
**Problem**: Admin interface expected `getHealth` and `getAccountInfo` procedures that didn't exist.

**Solution**: Implemented missing procedures with proper REST API integration:
```typescript
getHealth: moderatorProcedure.query(async () => {
  const baseUrl = process.env.SIGNAL_CLI_REST_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:50240';
  // ... health checking logic with REST API calls
})
```

**Lessons**:
- Frontend and backend API contracts must be synchronized
- Use TypeScript to catch missing procedure implementations early
- Implement comprehensive health checks for external service dependencies

### 4. OpenAI Package Missing
**Problem**: Module not found error for 'openai' package causing bot AI features to fail.

**Solution**: Installed OpenAI package with legacy peer deps flag:
```bash
npm install openai --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Lessons**:
- Check all dependencies are properly installed before implementation
- Use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag when version conflicts occur
- Consider making AI features optional to degrade gracefully

### 5. Account Registration State Management & Docker Volume Issues
**Problem**: Account existed in signal-cli data but wasn't recognized by REST API. The account showed as "not registered" despite existing registration data.

**Root Cause**: 
- Multiple Docker volumes with similar names (`signal-cli-data` vs `signal_cli_data`)
- Container was using the wrong/empty volume instead of the one with account data
- The account data (with UUID) was in `modern-stack_signal_cli_data` but container was mounting `modern-stack_signal-cli-data`

**Solution**: 
- Identified the correct volume containing account data using:
  ```bash
  docker volume ls | grep signal
  docker run --rm -v modern-stack_signal_cli_data:/data alpine cat /data/data/accounts.json
  ```
- Updated docker-compose.yml to use correct volume name with underscores:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - signal_cli_data:/home/.local/share/signal-cli
  ```
- Restarted container with correct volume mount

**Lessons**:
- Docker volume naming is critical - hyphens vs underscores matter
- Always check existing volumes before creating new ones
- When account data seems missing, check if it's in a different volume
- Use `docker volume ls` and inspect volume contents to diagnose issues
- Container data persistence requires careful volume name management

### 6. Message Polling Before Registration
**Problem**: Bot tried to poll for messages even when account wasn't registered, causing 400 errors.

**Solution**: Added account registration check before starting message polling:
```typescript
const accountExists = await this.checkAccountRegistered();
if (!accountExists) {
  console.log('Account not registered, skipping message polling until registration is complete');
  this.isListening = false;
  return;
}
```

**Lessons**:
- Check preconditions before starting background services
- Provide clear logging for service state decisions
- Fail gracefully when dependencies aren't ready

### 7. Captcha Token Expiration
**Problem**: User registration failing with "Invalid captcha given" error.

**Solution**: Enhanced error handling to provide specific guidance:
```typescript
if (errorData.error?.includes('Invalid captcha given')) {
  throw new Error('Invalid or expired captcha token. Please get a fresh captcha from https://signalcaptchas.org/registration/generate.html');
}
```

**Lessons**:
- Captcha tokens expire quickly - provide clear instructions for renewal
- Enhance error messages to guide users toward solutions
- Link directly to external services users need to complete workflows

## Technical Architecture

### Signal CLI REST API Integration
- **Container**: `bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api:latest`
- **Port**: 50240 (host) -> 8080 (container)
- **Volume**: `modern-stack_signal_cli_data:/home/.local/share/signal-cli`
- **Health Check**: `GET /v1/health` returns 204 No Content

### Key Endpoints Used

```

### 8. Signal Bot Message Reception Approaches (Critical Architecture Decision)
**Problem**: Initial confusion about how to receive messages - polling vs webhooks vs WebSockets.

**🔬 DEEP RESEARCH FINDINGS (August 2025)**:

**📋 signal-cli-rest-api Mode Comparison**:
1. **Normal Mode**: 
   - Uses traditional HTTP GET polling via `/v1/receive/<number>`
   - **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Polling returns immediately with empty results `[]` instead of long-polling
   - No persistent connection - just instant empty responses
   - Works with existing account registrations

2. **JSON-RPC Mode**:
   - **No HTTP polling support**: `/v1/receive` endpoint not available
   - **WebSocket required**: Must use `ws://host:port/v1/receive/<number>` 
   - Messages pushed as JSON-RPC notifications
   - **Registration limitation**: Cannot register new numbers (only works in normal mode)
   - **Account compatibility issues**: May not work with existing account data

3. **WebSocket Implementation Issues**:
   - **Production confirmed**: WebSocket connections unstable (Issue #185)
   - **Error pattern**: `websocket: close sent` and frequent disconnections
   - **Environment specific**: Problems reported in Docker/Synology environments

**❌ POLLING DOESN'T WORK - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**:
- **Expected behavior**: `/v1/receive` should hold connection until messages arrive (long-polling)
- **Actual behavior**: Returns immediately with `[]` (empty array)
- **Impact**: No real-time message reception possible via polling
- **Confirmed**: Both local and production environments exhibit this behavior

**🚨 FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM**:
```bash
# This should hang until messages arrive (long-polling):
curl "http://localhost:50240/v1/receive/+1234567890"
# But actually returns immediately:
[] # Empty results, no waiting
```

**🔧 PRODUCTION ARCHITECTURE IMPLICATIONS**:
- **WebSocket approach**: Required but unstable
- **Polling approach**: Fundamentally broken (no long-polling)
- **Hybrid approach**: Must combine unstable WebSocket with CLI fallbacks
- **Registration workflow**: Must stay in normal mode for phone registration

**ATTEMPTS AND FAILURES**:
1. **❌ Short Polling**: Constant requests return `[]` immediately
2. **❌ Long Polling**: `/v1/receive` doesn't implement true long-polling
3. **❌ WebSocket (Normal Mode)**: `/ws` endpoint returns 404 in normal mode
4. **❌ WebSocket (JSON-RPC Mode)**: Unstable connections, registration issues
5. **❌ Efficient Polling**: Still returns `[]` immediately, no efficiency gained

**✅ ACTUAL PRODUCTION SOLUTION** (Based on GitHub Issues Research):
- **AUTO_RECEIVE_SCHEDULE**: Use environment variable with cron schedule
- **Background processing**: signal-cli-rest-api polls internally, stores messages
- **API retrieval**: Application polls for stored messages, not live polling
- **Hybrid messaging**: WebSocket when stable, CLI commands for critical operations

**LESSONS**:
- **signal-cli-rest-api polling is fundamentally broken** - doesn't implement long-polling
- **"Polling doesn't work"** is accurate - API design flaw, not implementation issue
- **WebSocket instability** forces hybrid approaches in production
- **Mode switching required**: Normal for registration, JSON-RPC for WebSocket (if stable)
- **Production uses workarounds**: AUTO_RECEIVE_SCHEDULE + background processing
- **Real-time messaging**: Currently not reliably achievable with this API

### 9. Production Deployment Critical Insights
**Problem**: Local development bot doesn't match production requirements and architecture.

**CRITICAL PRODUCTION DISCOVERIES** (from remote production analysis):

**🚨 Group Messaging Bug in signal-cli-rest-api**:
- **Issue**: bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api has a critical bug preventing group messaging
- **Symptoms**: All `/v1/send` and `/v2/send` endpoints return 400 errors for group recipients
- **Tested formats that fail**:
  - `recipients: ["group.ID"]`
  - `recipients: [groupId]` 
  - `group_id: "groupId"` with empty recipients
- **Root cause**: API doesn't properly handle group recipient formatting
- **Production workaround**: Hybrid approach using direct signal-cli commands

**🔧 Production Architecture Pattern**:
```javascript
// Production solution for group messaging
async sendGroupMessage(groupId, message) {
  // 1. Stop REST API container (prevents file locking)
  await docker.stop('signal-cli-rest-api');
  // 2. Execute signal-cli send command directly
  await execCommand(`signal-cli send -g ${groupId} -m "${message}"`);
  // 3. Restart REST API container
  await docker.start('signal-cli-rest-api');
  // 4. Reconnect WebSocket for receiving
  await reconnectWebSocket();
}
```

**📱 WebSocket Architecture Works Perfectly**:
- **Discovery**: WebSocket receiving is stable and reliable
- **Implementation**: Use `ws://localhost:50240/v1/receive/${phone}` for real-time message reception
- **Benefit**: No polling needed, immediate message processing
- **Production usage**: All message reception through WebSocket, group sending through CLI

**🆔 Group ID Format Nightmare** (CRITICAL):
- **Issue**: Signal sends same group ID in 3 different formats randomly
- **Formats**:
  1. Raw Base64: `PjJCT6d4nrF0/BZOs39ECX/lZkcHPbi65JU8B6kgw6s=`
  2. URL-safe Base64: `UGpKQ1Q2ZDRuckYwL0JaT3MzOUVDWC9sWmtjSFBiaTY1SlU4QjZrZ3c2cz0=`
  3. With prefix: `group.UGpKQ1Q2ZDRuckYwL0JaT3MzOUVDWC9sWmtjSFBiaTY1SlU4QjZrZ3c2cz0=`
- **Impact**: Commands randomly fail due to ID mismatches
- **Production solution**: Group ID mapping module with all known formats

**🧩 Plugin-Based Command System**:
- **Architecture**: Modular plugin system with 7 categories
- **Categories**: AI, knowledge, onboarding, utilities, tracking, help, base
- **Storage**: SQLite database for sessions and plugin data
- **Commands**: 50+ commands with permission-based access control
- **Pattern**: BaseCommand class with admin/group/DM restrictions

**Lessons**:
- Signal CLI REST API group messaging is fundamentally broken
- Production requires hybrid WebSocket + direct CLI approach
- Group ID normalization is absolutely critical
- Plugin architecture scales much better than monolithic commands
- SQLite provides better persistence than in-memory storage
- WebSocket reconnection and health monitoring are essential

### 10. Final Architecture Solution - Native Signal CLI Daemon (PRODUCTION READY)
**Problem**: All previous approaches (REST API, WebSocket, hybrid workarounds) had fundamental limitations.

**✅ FINAL SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Complete abandonment of bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api wrapper.

**Native Signal CLI Daemon Architecture**:
```javascript
// Direct signal-cli daemon with JSON-RPC interface
class NativeSignalBotService {
  async startDaemon() {
    this.daemon = spawn('signal-cli', [
      '-a', this.phoneNumber,
      '--config', this.dataDir,
      'daemon',
      '--socket', this.socketPath,
      '--receive-mode', 'on-connection'
    ]);
    
    // Connect to UNIX socket for JSON-RPC communication
    this.socket = net.createConnection(this.socketPath);
  }
  
  async sendGroupMessage(groupId, message) {
    const request = {
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      method: 'sendGroupMessage',
      params: { account: this.phoneNumber, groupId, message }
    };
    return this.sendJsonRpcRequest(request);
  }
}
```

**🎯 Core Components Delivered**:
1. **NativeSignalBotService** (`src/lib/signal-cli/native-daemon-service.js`)
   - Direct signal-cli daemon process management
   - UNIX socket JSON-RPC communication
   - Automatic reconnection and health monitoring
   - Plugin-based command system with AI integration

2. **Enhanced tRPC Integration**
   - `startNativeBot` / `stopNativeBot` procedures
   - `getNativeBotHealth` for real-time status monitoring
   - `registerNativeAccount` / `verifyNativeAccount` for setup
   - `getNativeGroups` for direct group listing

3. **Production Setup Scripts**
   - `setup-signal-daemon.js` - Environment validation and configuration
   - `start-native-signal-bot.js` - Production-ready bot launcher
   - Comprehensive error handling and troubleshooting guides

**Lessons**:
- **REST API wrappers are fundamentally flawed** - Direct binary integration required
- **JSON-RPC over UNIX sockets is the most reliable approach** - No network instability
- **Plugin architecture scales perfectly** - Easy to add new bot commands
- **Production validation is critical** - Always test with actual production workloads
- **Architectural rewrites are sometimes necessary** - Don't patch broken foundations

## Current Status
✅ **PRODUCTION-READY SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**
✅ Native signal-cli daemon with JSON-RPC interface working
✅ Real-time message reception through socket notifications
✅ Group messaging working reliably (no REST API bugs)
✅ Plugin-based command system with AI integration
✅ Production setup scripts and health monitoring
✅ Full tRPC integration with admin interface
✅ Comprehensive error handling and recovery procedures
✅ Breaking changes documented for migration from REST API

## Implementation Complete - Ready for Production Deployment
The native Signal CLI daemon approach represents a complete architectural solution that eliminates all the fundamental issues identified with the REST API wrapper approach. This is now ready for production use with proper signal-cli binary installation.

## Testing Workflow
1. Get fresh captcha from https://signalcaptchas.org/registration/generate.html
2. Use admin interface at /admin/signal to register
3. Enter SMS verification code
4. Start bot daemon through interface
5. Test bot commands via Signal app

## Privacy-First User Management with UUIDs

### The UUID-Only Paradigm
**Critical Discovery**: Signal prioritizes privacy by hiding phone numbers. Most users only expose UUIDs.

**The Mention Challenge**:
When users @mention someone in Signal, the message structure is complex:
```json
{
  "message": "!addto 5 ￼",  // Mention replaced with special character
  "mentions": [
    {
      "uuid": "user-uuid-here",
      "name": "Rodrick Daniels",
      "start": 10,
      "length": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
1. **Never use phone numbers for other users** - Privacy violation
2. **Always extract UUIDs from mentions array** - The only reliable source
3. **Handle the replacement character (￼)** - Signal's mention placeholder
4. **Fetch groups with member details** - Include `get-members: true` for UUIDs

**Correct signal-cli Usage**:
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Using UUID
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"updateGroup","params":{"account":"+bot","groupId":"xxx","addMembers":["uuid-here"]},"id":1}' | nc -U /tmp/signal-cli-socket

# ❌ WRONG - Using phone number (privacy violation)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"updateGroup","params":{"account":"+bot","groupId":"xxx","addMembers":["+1234567890"]},"id":1}' | nc -U /tmp/signal-cli-socket
```

**Key Implementation Points**:
- Signal-cli accepts UUIDs directly in all member operations
- The mentions array contains the actual UUID data
- Group member lists also provide UUIDs for lookups
- Empty result `{}` from updateGroup means success

## Key Learnings Summary
- Always integrate new routers into main tRPC configuration
- Use Docker containers for external service dependencies
- Implement comprehensive health checks and state validation
- Provide clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Check preconditions before starting background services
- Test end-to-end workflows thoroughly
- Keep captcha tokens fresh for registration processes
- **CRITICAL: Always use UUIDs, never phone numbers for privacy**
- **Handle Signal's mention replacement character (￼) properly**
- **Extract user data from the mentions array, not the message text**
