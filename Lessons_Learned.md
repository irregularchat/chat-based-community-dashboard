## Python Import Issues

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'Config' referenced before assignment`

**Root Cause**: Having multiple `from app.utils.config import Config` statements within the same file - one at the top level and others inside functions. Python treats variables as local if they're assigned anywhere in the function scope, even if the assignment comes after the reference.

**Problem**: `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'get_db' where it is not associated with a value`

**Root Cause**: Same issue as above but with different imports. Having multiple `from app.db.session import get_db` statements - one at the top level and others inside functions causes Python to treat `get_db` as a local variable.

**Problem**: `Cannot close a running event loop`

**Root Cause**: Attempting to close an event loop that is still running or trying to manage event loops incorrectly in Streamlit context. This often happens when mixing `asyncio.get_event_loop()`, `asyncio.new_event_loop()`, and `loop.close()` calls.

```python
# At top of file
from app.utils.config import Config

async def main_function():
    if not Config.MATRIX_ACTIVE:  # ‚ùå UnboundLocalError here
        return
    
    # ... later in the function or in helper functions
    def helper_function():
        from app.utils.config import Config  # ‚ùå This causes the error
        return Config.SOME_VALUE
```

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Remove all redundant import statements within functions and rely on the top-level import.

```python
# At top of file
from app.utils.config import Config
from app.db.session import get_db

async def main_function():
    if not Config.MATRIX_ACTIVE:  # ‚úÖ Works correctly
        return
    
    db = next(get_db())  # ‚úÖ Works correctly
    
    def helper_function():
        # ‚úÖ Use the top-level imports, no local imports needed
        return Config.SOME_VALUE
```

**Solution**: Simplify event loop management and avoid closing loops that may still be running.

```python
# ‚ùå Problematic event loop management
loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
# ... some async operations ...
loop.close()  # Error: Cannot close a running event loop

# ‚úÖ Simplified approach - let threading handle loop lifecycle
def bg_sync():
    try:
        loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
        asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
        try:
            loop.run_until_complete(async_function())
        finally:
            loop.close()  # Safe to close here after run_until_complete
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Background sync error: {e}")

threading.Thread(target=bg_sync, daemon=True).start()
```

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Always import modules at the top level** of the file
2. **Avoid redundant imports** within functions unless absolutely necessary
3. **Use grep to check for duplicate imports**: `grep -n "from.*import" filename.py`
4. **Test imports in isolation** when debugging import issues
5. **Check for all common imports** like `Config`, `get_db`, `User` model, etc.
6. **Simplify event loop management** - avoid manual loop creation/closing in Streamlit
7. **Use threading for background async tasks** instead of trying to manage loops directly
8. **Always wrap event loop operations in try/except** with proper cleanup

## Streamlit Development Best Practices

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: Modifying widget state after instantiation
```python
# ‚ùå This causes errors
st.session_state.confirm_user_removal = False  # After widget creation
```

**Problem**: Using regular buttons inside forms
```python
# ‚ùå This causes StreamlitAPIException
with st.form("my_form"):
    # ... form inputs ...
    if st.button("Copy Link"):  # Error: can't use st.button() in st.form()
        # ... copy logic ...
```

**Problem**: Not handling session state persistence properly across reruns

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Proper session state management
```python
# ‚úÖ Initialize before widget creation
if 'confirm_user_removal' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.confirm_user_removal = False

# ‚úÖ Use callbacks for state updates
def on_user_selection_change():
    st.session_state.selected_users = st.session_state.user_multiselect

st.multiselect("Users", options=users, on_change=on_user_selection_change, key="user_multiselect")
```

**Solution**: Move buttons outside forms or use session state to pass data
```python
# ‚úÖ Store data in session state inside form, button outside
with st.form("my_form"):
    # ... form inputs ...
    if submit_button:
        if result.get('success'):
            invite_link = result.get('invite_link')
            st.session_state['created_invite_link'] = invite_link

# ‚úÖ Button outside the form
if 'created_invite_link' in st.session_state:
    if st.button("üìã Copy", key="copy_btn"):
        pyperclip.copy(st.session_state['created_invite_link'])
        del st.session_state['created_invite_link']
```

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Initialize session state variables early** in the function
2. **Use unique keys** for all widgets to avoid conflicts
3. **Use callbacks** for complex state management instead of direct modification
4. **Test widget interactions** thoroughly, especially with multiple selections
5. **Cache expensive operations** using `@st.cache_data` or session state
6. **Only use `st.form_submit_button()`** inside forms - regular `st.button()` will cause errors
7. **Move interactive buttons outside forms** or use session state to pass data between form and buttons

## Matrix Integration Challenges

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: Bot permission issues preventing user removal
- Bot had only Moderator privileges instead of Admin
- Removal operations failed with `M_FORBIDDEN` errors

**Problem**: Relying on stale local cache for room memberships

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Multi-layered approach to user removal
1. **Live verification** of user memberships from Matrix API
2. **Smart filtering** to only attempt removal from rooms where users are actually members
3. **Enhanced error handling** with specific error messages
4. **Automatic cache refresh** after successful operations

```python
# ‚úÖ Live verification approach
try:
    client = await get_matrix_client()
    all_bot_rooms = await get_joined_rooms_async(client)
    
    for room_id in all_bot_rooms:
        room_members = await get_room_members_async(client, room_id)
        if user_id in room_members:
            user_actual_room_ids.append(room_id)
except Exception as e:
    # Fallback to database cache
    logger.warning(f"Using database fallback: {e}")
```

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Always verify bot permissions** before attempting administrative actions
2. **Use live API calls** for critical operations, with database cache as fallback
3. **Implement comprehensive error handling** with specific error types
4. **Log all Matrix operations** for audit trails
5. **Test with actual Matrix rooms** in development environment

## Database and Session Management

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: Database session conflicts and unclosed connections
```python
# ‚ùå Session management issues
db = next(get_db())
# ... operations without proper cleanup
```

**Problem**: SQLite-specific function issues
```
sqlite3.OperationalError: no such function: string_agg
```

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Proper session management with try/finally blocks
```python
# ‚úÖ Proper session handling
db = next(get_db())
try:
    # Database operations
    result = db.query(Model).all()
    db.commit()
finally:
    db.close()
```

**Solution**: Database-agnostic queries or conditional SQL

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Always use try/finally** for database session cleanup
2. **Test with both SQLite and PostgreSQL** if supporting multiple databases
3. **Use database-agnostic ORM methods** when possible
4. **Monitor for unclosed sessions** in logs
5. **Implement connection pooling** for production environments

## Error Handling and Debugging Strategies

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: Silent failures without proper error reporting
**Problem**: Generic error messages that don't help with debugging
**Problem**: Not testing edge cases (empty user lists, network failures, etc.)

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Comprehensive error handling strategy
```python
# ‚úÖ Detailed error handling
try:
    result = await some_operation()
    if result:
        logger.info(f"Operation successful: {result}")
        return result
    else:
        logger.warning("Operation returned no result")
        return None
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error(f"Specific error in operation: {e}")
    # Handle specific case
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error in operation: {e}", exc_info=True)
    # Handle general case
```

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Create isolated test scripts** for debugging complex issues
2. **Use specific exception handling** rather than generic `except Exception`
3. **Log with appropriate levels** (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
4. **Include context** in error messages (user IDs, room IDs, etc.)
5. **Test error conditions** explicitly (network failures, permission issues)
6. **Use `exc_info=True`** for detailed stack traces in logs

## Code Organization and Structure

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: Massive functions with multiple responsibilities
**Problem**: Inconsistent indentation causing syntax errors
**Problem**: Mixing UI logic with business logic

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Modular function design
```python
# ‚úÖ Separate concerns
async def render_matrix_messaging_page():
    """Main UI rendering function"""
    if not _validate_matrix_config():
        return
    
    matrix_rooms = _get_cached_rooms()
    _render_room_selection_ui(matrix_rooms)
    _render_messaging_ui()

def _validate_matrix_config():
    """Helper function for validation"""
    return Config.MATRIX_ACTIVE

def _get_cached_rooms():
    """Helper function for data fetching"""
    # Implementation
```

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Break large functions** into smaller, focused functions
2. **Use consistent indentation** (4 spaces for Python)
3. **Separate UI rendering** from business logic
4. **Use descriptive function names** that indicate purpose
5. **Add docstrings** for complex functions
6. **Use helper functions** with leading underscore for internal use

## SSL/TLS and Network Issues

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: SSL version compatibility issues
```
[SSL: TLSV1_ALERT_PROTOCOL_VERSION] tlsv1 alert protocol version
```

**Problem**: Network timeouts without proper retry logic

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Flexible SSL configuration
```python
# ‚úÖ Configurable SSL settings
ssl_context = ssl.create_default_context()
if Config.MATRIX_DISABLE_SSL_VERIFICATION:
    ssl_context.check_hostname = False
    ssl_context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
```

**Solution**: Retry logic with exponential backoff

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Make SSL settings configurable** for different environments
2. **Implement retry logic** for network operations
3. **Use connection pooling** to reduce connection overhead
4. **Log network errors** with sufficient detail for debugging
5. **Test with different network conditions** (slow, unreliable connections)

## Standard Operating Procedures

### Development Workflow

1. **Before making changes:**
   - Test current functionality to establish baseline
   - Create isolated test scripts for complex features
   - Check for existing similar implementations

2. **During development:**
   - Make small, incremental changes
   - Test each change immediately
   - Use proper error handling from the start
   - Log important operations for debugging

3. **After making changes:**
   - Test the specific functionality changed
   - Test related functionality that might be affected
   - Check logs for any new errors or warnings
   - Verify imports and syntax with `python -m py_compile`

### Debugging Workflow

1. **Identify the problem:**
   - Check logs for specific error messages
   - Isolate the failing component
   - Create minimal reproduction case

2. **Investigate systematically:**
   - Check imports and dependencies
   - Verify configuration values
   - Test with simplified inputs
   - Use debugging scripts to isolate issues

3. **Fix and verify:**
   - Make targeted fixes
   - Test the fix in isolation
   - Test integration with the full system
   - Update documentation if needed

### Code Quality Checklist

## Key Takeaways

1. **Python import scoping** can cause subtle bugs - always import at module level
2. **Streamlit session state** requires careful management - use callbacks and proper initialization
3. **Streamlit forms** have restrictions - only `st.form_submit_button()` allowed inside, move other buttons outside
4. **Asyncio event loop management** in Streamlit requires careful handling - avoid manual loop closing
5. **Matrix API operations** need live verification and comprehensive error handling
6. **Database sessions** must be properly managed to avoid connection leaks
7. **Error handling** should be specific and informative, not generic
8. **Code organization** matters - break large functions into focused, testable units
9. **Network operations** need retry logic and proper SSL configuration
10. **Testing** should cover both happy path and error conditions
11. **Logging** is crucial for debugging complex async operations
12. **Configuration** should be externalized and validated at startup
