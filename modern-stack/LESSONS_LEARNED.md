# Lessons Learned

## Matrix User Search and Multi-Select Implementation (2024-08-16)

### Issue Description
The search functionality in Matrix user dropdowns wasn't working - users could see the list but searching/filtering had no effect. Additionally, there was a need to select and process multiple users at once for bulk operations.

### Root Causes
1. **Data Format Mismatch**: API returned `user_id` (snake_case) but frontend expected `userId` (camelCase)
2. **Event Propagation**: Search input events were being captured by the Select component
3. **Missing Database Columns**: Signal verification fields referenced in code didn't exist in database
4. **Single User Limitation**: Original implementation only supported one user at a time

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Fixed Data Format Consistency
```typescript
// In matrix router - convert to camelCase for frontend
const formattedUsers = users.map(user => ({
  userId: user.user_id,           // was user_id
  displayName: user.display_name, // was display_name
  avatarUrl: user.avatar_url,     // was avatar_url
  isSignalUser: user.is_signal_user
}));
```

#### 2. Proper Event Handling in Dropdowns
```typescript
// Stop propagation to prevent Select from interfering
<Input
  onChange={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    setInviteUserSearch(e.target.value);
  }}
  onKeyDown={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    if (e.key === 'Enter') e.preventDefault();
  }}
/>
```

#### 3. Multi-Select UI Implementation
- Added state arrays for tracking multiple selected users
- Visual badges show selected users with click-to-remove
- Dynamic button text shows count of users being processed
- Automatic switching between single and batch operations

#### 4. Batch API Operations
Created new endpoints for processing multiple users:
- `inviteUsersToRooms`: Invite multiple users to multiple rooms
- `removeUsersFromRooms`: Remove multiple users from multiple rooms

### Key Learning Points

#### API Data Contract Consistency
- **Always maintain consistent naming conventions** between API and frontend
- **Use TypeScript interfaces** to catch mismatches early
- **Transform at API boundary** rather than throughout the codebase

#### React Select Component Event Handling
- **Event bubbling issues** in nested interactive elements require stopPropagation
- **Custom search in Select** needs careful event management
- **Consider alternatives** like Combobox for complex search needs

#### Database Schema Management
- **Always run migrations** before using new fields
- **Use Prisma generate** after schema changes
- **Comment out fields temporarily** if migration isn't ready yet

#### UX Improvements for Bulk Operations
- **Multi-select saves time** for repetitive operations
- **Visual feedback important** - show selected items clearly
- **Batch operations** reduce API calls and improve performance
- **Smart fallback** - use single operation for one item, batch for multiple

### Code Patterns

```typescript
// Good: Handle both single and multiple selections
const usersToProcess = selectedUsers.length > 0 ? selectedUsers : 
                       manualInput ? [manualInput] : [];

if (usersToProcess.length > 1) {
  await batchMutation.mutateAsync({ userIds: usersToProcess });
} else {
  await singleMutation.mutateAsync({ userId: usersToProcess[0] });
}
```

## Matrix Room Display and SDK Bundling Issues (2024-08-16)

### Issue Description
Matrix rooms with >10 members were not displaying in the UI. Additionally, the Matrix SDK was causing "Multiple entrypoints detected" bundling errors, preventing the Matrix client from initializing properly.

### Root Causes
1. **SDK Bundling Issue**: The matrix-js-sdk was being imported multiple times, causing Next.js bundling conflicts
2. **Service Configuration Check**: The `isConfigured()` method returned false when the Matrix client failed to initialize
3. **Room Data Source**: Duplicate rooms were being shown - configured rooms from .env (with 0 members) and cached rooms from database

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Fixed Matrix SDK Initialization
- Added fallback mechanism when SDK wrapper fails
- Modified `isConfigured()` to return true if config exists, even if client fails
- This allows cached rooms to be fetched from database even when SDK has issues

#### 2. Database Caching Strategy
- Rooms are cached in the MatrixRoom table with:
  - Room ID, name, topic
  - Member count (actual numbers from Matrix server)
  - Last synced timestamp
- Cache is queried first, avoiding repeated Matrix API calls
- Periodic sync (every 12 hours) keeps data fresh

#### 3. Removed .env Room Configurations
- Commented out MATRIX_ROOM_IDS_NAME_CATEGORY variable
- Changed default `includeConfigured` to false
- Now using only cached/indexed rooms from database

### Key Learning Points

#### Database Caching for External Services
- **Cache expensive API calls**: Matrix room queries are cached in database
- **Include metadata**: Store room ID, name, member count for efficient filtering
- **Periodic updates**: Sync every 12 hours to keep data fresh
- **Fallback gracefully**: Use cache when external service fails

#### SDK Bundling in Next.js
- Dynamic imports can cause "multiple entrypoints" errors
- Implement fallback mechanisms for SDK initialization failures
- Service configuration checks should not depend solely on client initialization

#### Room Data Management Pattern
```typescript
// Good: Use cached data with periodic sync
const rooms = await cacheService.getCachedRooms();
if (rooms.length === 0 && matrixClient) {
  // Fallback to direct fetch if cache empty
  const freshRooms = await matrixClient.getRooms();
  await cacheService.updateRooms(freshRooms);
}

// Bad: Always fetching from Matrix API
const rooms = await matrixClient.getRooms(); // Expensive and fails if client not initialized
```

### Results
- Successfully displaying 40+ cached rooms with actual member counts
- Eliminated duplicate rooms with 0 members from .env
- Matrix functionality works even when SDK fails to initialize
- Improved performance by using database cache instead of repeated API calls

## Configuration Status Display Fix (Previous Issue)

## Issue Description
The admin configuration page was showing all services (Matrix, Authentik, Discourse, SMTP, AI APIs) as "Not Configured" even though they were properly configured via environment variables and working correctly.

## Root Cause
The configuration page was only checking database settings (`allSettings?.settings?.[configKey]`) rather than checking the actual service status from environment variables and service instances.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Service Configuration Status API
- Created `getServicesConfig` endpoint in settings router
- Checks actual service instances and environment variables
- Returns real-time configuration status for all services

### 2. Updated Configuration Page Logic
- Modified `isServiceConfigured` helper function to check actual service status
- Added service-specific checks:
  - **Matrix**: Uses `matrixConfig?.isConfigured` from Matrix service
  - **Authentik**: Uses `authentikService.isConfigured()`
  - **Discourse**: Checks environment variables directly
  - **SMTP**: Uses `emailService.isConfigured()`
  - **AI APIs**: Checks for API keys in environment

### 3. Enhanced Display Information
- Shows configuration source (Environment Variables vs Database Settings)
- Displays actual configuration values from running services
- Provides real-time status updates

## Key Learning Points

### Environment Variable Configuration Priority
- Services should be configured primarily via environment variables
- Database settings should be secondary/fallback configuration
- Admin UI should reflect actual service status, not just database records

### Service Configuration Patterns
1. **Check actual service instances** for configuration status
2. **Validate environment variables** at runtime
3. **Display configuration source** to users for transparency
4. **Avoid database-only configuration checks** when services use env vars

### Implementation Pattern
```typescript
// Bad: Only checking database
const isConfigured = !!allSettings?.settings?.[configKey];

// Good: Checking actual service status
const isConfigured = serviceInstance.isConfigured();
```

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/trpc/routers/settings.ts` - Added getServicesConfig endpoint
- `src/app/admin/configuration/page.tsx` - Updated configuration status logic
- Configuration display sections for all services

## Testing Approach
- Created test endpoint `/api/test-configs` to verify all services
- Confirmed all services show as configured: ✅
- Verified configuration page displays correct status in browser

## Prevention for Future
1. Always check actual service status rather than just database settings
2. Create API endpoints to verify service configuration in real-time
3. Test configuration display with actual environment variable setup
4. Document configuration sources clearly in the UI

## Related Issues
- Database connection issues required proper `.env.local` setup
- Matrix SDK conflicts in API routes (resolved by avoiding direct imports)
- Authentication setup needed admin user creation script

## Matrix Sync Database Tables Issue

### Problem
Matrix sync failed with error: "The table `public.matrix_rooms` does not exist in the current database"

### Root Cause
Prisma migrations were out of sync, causing Matrix cache tables to not be created in the database despite being defined in the schema.

### Solution
1. Force reset and push schema: `npx prisma db push --force-reset`
2. This created all necessary tables including:
   - `matrix_users`
   - `matrix_rooms`
   - `MatrixRoomMembership`
3. Recreate admin user after database reset

### Prevention
- Always run `npx prisma db push` or `npx prisma migrate dev` after schema changes
- Check migration status before deployment
- Ensure DATABASE_URL is properly set when running migrations

## React State Management Issues

### Problem 1: Infinite Loop in useEffect
Component had `useEffect` that was setting state from query data that gets recreated on every render, causing infinite re-renders.

### Root Cause
The tRPC query returns a new array reference on each render even with the same data, triggering useEffect dependencies.

### Solution
Remove unnecessary state duplication - directly use the query data instead of copying it to local state.

```typescript
// Bad: Causes infinite loop
const { data: matrixUsersData = [] } = trpc.matrix.getUsers.useQuery();
const [matrixUsers, setMatrixUsers] = useState([]);
useEffect(() => {
  setMatrixUsers(matrixUsersData); // Infinite loop!
}, [matrixUsersData]);

// Good: Direct usage
const { data: matrixUsers = [] } = trpc.matrix.getUsers.useQuery();
```

### Problem 2: Select Component Empty String Values
React Select components throw error when using empty string as a value because it's reserved for clearing selection.

### Solution
Use a non-empty string like "all" for the default/all option:

```typescript
// Bad
const [category, setCategory] = useState('');
<SelectItem value="">All Categories</SelectItem>

// Good
const [category, setCategory] = useState('all');
<SelectItem value="all">All Categories</SelectItem>
// Update query to handle 'all' value
category: category === 'all' ? undefined : category
```

### Prevention
- Avoid duplicating query data in local state
- Never use empty strings as Select option values
- Use meaningful default values like 'all', 'none', etc.

## Matrix User Sync Issues

### Problem
Matrix user sync returns 0 users and 0 rooms, showing "No Matrix users found" in the UI.

### Root Cause
The Matrix bot account (@bot.irregularchat:irregularchat.com) needs to be joined to Matrix rooms to be able to see users and room membership. The bot can only sync data from rooms it has access to.

### Solution
1. **Join the bot to Matrix rooms**: The bot account must be invited to and join the Matrix rooms you want to sync users from
2. **Check bot permissions**: Ensure the bot has appropriate permissions in the rooms
3. **Verify room membership**: The sync only processes rooms with more than the minimum member count (default 10)

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. Check if Matrix service is configured: `Matrix service initialized successfully` in logs
2. Verify bot credentials are correct in .env.local
3. Ensure the bot account is joined to at least one room
4. Check the minimum room member setting: `MATRIX_MIN_ROOM_MEMBERS` (default 10)

### Prevention
- Document that the Matrix bot must be joined to rooms before sync will work
- Add a check to warn if bot has no rooms joined
- Consider adding a "join room" feature in the admin panel
- Provide clear error messages when sync finds no rooms

## Matrix Direct Message Encryption Error

### Problem
Direct messages fail with error: "This room is configured to use encryption, but your client does not support encryption." Messages show as "sent successfully" but users don't receive them.

### Root Cause
The Matrix service was configured with encryption disabled (`🔐 Matrix encryption DISABLED`), but Signal bridge rooms require encryption. The client attempts to send messages to encrypted rooms without encryption support, causing silent failures.

### Solution
1. **Disable encryption** in Matrix configuration to avoid encrypted room conflicts:
   ```env
   MATRIX_ENABLE_ENCRYPTION=false
   ```
2. **Use fallback messaging approach** that avoids encrypted Signal bridge rooms
3. **Install encryption dependencies** if encryption is needed:
   ```bash
   npm install @matrix-org/olm
   mkdir -p public/olm
   cp node_modules/@matrix-org/olm/olm.wasm public/olm/
   ```

### Key Success Indicators
When working correctly, logs show:
- `✅ BRIDGE: Found Signal chat room: !roomId`
- `✅ ENCRYPTION: Main message sent successfully: $eventId`
- `Message sent successfully to @user:domain.com in room !roomId`

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. Check Matrix encryption status in logs: `🔐 Matrix encryption ENABLED/DISABLED`
2. Verify Signal bridge room access without encryption conflicts
3. Monitor message sending logs for successful event IDs
4. Test with both Signal users and regular Matrix users

### Prevention
- Configure Matrix encryption consistently with target room requirements
- Implement proper error handling for encryption mismatches
- Add logging for successful message delivery confirmation
- Test direct messaging with both encrypted and non-encrypted scenarios

## Matrix SDK Multiple Entrypoints Bundling Error

### Problem
Matrix sync and other Matrix operations fail with bundling error: "Multiple matrix-js-sdk entrypoints detected!" causing 500 errors on tRPC API calls.

### Root Cause
Both `matrix.ts` and `user.ts` tRPC routers were importing `matrixService` from `@/lib/matrix` at the top level, causing Turbo/Webpack to detect multiple entrypoints for the matrix-js-sdk library during bundling.

### Solution
Use dynamic imports for Matrix service in tRPC routers instead of top-level imports:

```typescript
// Bad: Top-level import causes bundling conflicts
import { matrixService } from '@/lib/matrix';

// Good: Dynamic import avoids bundling conflicts
export const someEndpoint = procedure.query(async ({ ctx }) => {
  const { matrixService } = await import('@/lib/matrix');
  return matrixService.someMethod();
});
```

### Key Success Indicators
When working correctly, logs show:
- `Matrix service initialized successfully` without SDK errors
- API endpoints return proper 401/403 auth errors instead of 500 server errors
- No "Multiple matrix-js-sdk entrypoints detected!" errors in stderr

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/trpc/routers/matrix.ts` - Updated getConfig and syncMatrixUsers functions
- `src/lib/trpc/routers/user.ts` - Updated Matrix welcome message functionality

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. Check for multiple imports of `@/lib/matrix` across tRPC routers
2. Look for "Multiple matrix-js-sdk entrypoints detected!" in build logs
3. Convert top-level Matrix imports to dynamic imports in API routes
4. Test API endpoints return auth errors instead of 500 server errors

### Prevention
- Use dynamic imports for heavy libraries in API routes
- Avoid importing Matrix SDK directly in multiple modules
- Centralize Matrix service access through single entry point
- Test bundling with development server after Matrix-related changes

## Admin Message Import Error Fix (2024-08-16)

### Problem
"Failed to send message to admin" error with 500 status when trying to send messages to the INDOC room. Console showed `ReferenceError: matrixService is not defined`.

### Root Cause
The user router (`src/lib/trpc/routers/user.ts`) was using `matrixService` without importing it. The service was being referenced in the admin message functionality at line 1794 but the import statement was missing.

### Solution
Added dynamic import for matrixService before usage:

```typescript
// Added this line before using matrixService
const { matrixService } = await import('@/lib/matrix');
if (matrixService.isConfigured()) {
  const indocRoom = process.env.MATRIX_INDOC_ROOM_ID || process.env.MATRIX_ADMIN_ROOM_ID;
  if (indocRoom) {
    await matrixService.sendRoomMessage(indocRoom, matrixMessage);
  }
}
```

### Key Learning Points

#### Import Before Use Pattern
- **Always import services** before using them in tRPC procedures
- **Use dynamic imports** for Matrix service to avoid bundling conflicts
- **Check for undefined services** can indicate missing imports

#### Error Diagnosis
- **500 errors in tRPC** often indicate server-side code issues
- **ReferenceError messages** clearly indicate missing imports
- **Check network tab** for detailed error messages in API responses

### Prevention
- Always import required services at the top of procedure functions
- Use TypeScript to catch undefined references during development
- Test admin functionality after Matrix service refactoring
- Review all tRPC procedures that reference external services
