You’re tracking the big stuff (MARCH, prolonged field care, blood, hypothermia) — but modern conflicts, especially Ukraine, have forced rapid updates in TCCC and battlefield medicine. Here’s what’s new or emphasized lately:

⸻

1. Blood & Resuscitation
	•	Walking Blood Banks are now standard practice in Ukrainian units.
	•	Cold-stored whole blood is staged closer to the line when refrigeration exists.
	•	Dried plasma is widespread because of logistics simplicity.
	•	Shift away from crystalloids is now universal — many Ukrainian medics don’t even pack saline beyond IV flush.

⸻

2. Tourniquets & Bleeding Control
	•	Wider adoption of junctional tourniquets (groin, axilla, neck base).
	•	Hemostatic dressings are no longer just “nice-to-have” — they’re issued down to squad level.
	•	Multiple tourniquets per limb is taught (especially with blast/FPV drone injuries).

⸻

3. Airway & Breathing
	•	Needle decompression now emphasized at the 5th intercostal space mid-axillary line (safer than old 2nd ICS).
	•	Supraglottic airways (iGel) preferred over intubation in field — faster, fewer complications.
	•	Chest seals: vented types standard to avoid tension pneumothorax.

⸻

4. Hypothermia & Head Injury
	•	Hypothermia prevention kits are packed forward — reflective blankets, heat packs, insulated litters.
	•	TBI care stressed: eye shields, avoiding secondary injury, head elevation when possible.

⸻

5. Analgesia & Antibiotics
	•	Combat pain management shifted from morphine to ketamine + TXA protocols (less risk of respiratory depression).
	•	TXA (Tranexamic Acid) within 1–3 hrs of injury is standard to stop clot breakdown.
	•	Antibiotics (moxifloxacin oral or ertapenem injection) pushed earlier, even by non-medics, due to high infection rates.

⸻

6. Prolonged Field Care (PFC)
	•	Ukraine showed evacuation delays (hours to days).
	•	Training now emphasizes:
	•	Casualty monitoring (vitals over time).
	•	Field-expedient nursing care (turning, hydration, wound care).
	•	Improvised blood storage and transfusion.

⸻

7. Civilian–Military Lessons
	•	High use of FPV drones means more blast + multi-shrapnel casualties, not just GSWs.
	•	Burn injuries are way more common (vehicles, artillery, drone strikes).
	•	Massive focus on casualty collection points (CCPs) and peer first aid because evacuation may be impossible during shelling.

⸻

8. Documentation & Tech
	•	Digital casualty cards / QR-coded TCCC cards used in Ukraine for tracking.
	•	Casualty evacuation apps integrated with drones, ATAK, and unit comms.

⸻

👉 In short:
	•	Bleeding control is king (more junctional injuries now).
	•	Blood > saline is gospel.
	•	Hypothermia kits, TXA, antibiotics, and prolonged care skills are essential.
	•	Blast + burn injuries are far more common than classic gunshot wounds.
