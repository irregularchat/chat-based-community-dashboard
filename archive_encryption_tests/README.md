# Archived Encryption Test Files

This directory contains test files that were used during the development of Matrix message encryption and decryption functionality.

## Why These Files Are Archived

The Matrix encryption functionality was disabled for simplicity because:

1. **Complexity**: Matrix E2E encryption requires complex key management, device verification, and session handling
2. **User Experience**: Encryption setup requires manual verification steps that are difficult for non-technical users
3. **Historical Messages**: Encrypted messages sent before the bot joined conversations cannot be decrypted without the original keys
4. **Signal Bridge Compatibility**: Signal bridge messages require specific encryption handling that was proving problematic

## What Was Removed

- Matrix encryption configuration variables from `.env-template` and `config.py`
- Message history functionality from the UI (requires encryption to work properly)
- Encryption-enabled Matrix client configuration
- All encryption-related test files (moved to this archive)

## Current Functionality

The Matrix integration now works in a simplified mode:
- ✅ Sending messages to users and rooms works
- ✅ User and room management works
- ❌ Message history is disabled (requires encryption)
- ❌ Reading encrypted messages is disabled

## Security Note

All Signal user UUIDs in these test files have been sanitized and replaced with placeholder values (`XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX`) for privacy.

## Future Considerations

If encryption functionality needs to be restored in the future:
1. Re-enable encryption variables in configuration
2. Restore encryption-enabled Matrix client
3. Implement proper key management and device verification
4. Test with these archived test files (after updating UUIDs)
