# OAuth SSO Troubleshooting Summary

## üîç Current Status: OAUTH CALLBACK ERROR - Advanced Community Help Needed

After extensive troubleshooting and implementing all standard community fixes from NextAuth GitHub discussions, we're experiencing a persistent `OAuthCallbackError: state mismatch` that requires advanced debugging techniques.

## üìã Problem Summary

**Issue**: NextAuth.js v4.24.11 OAuth callback fails with `state mismatch, expected undefined, got: ` when using external Authentik OIDC provider.

**Environment**: 
- Next.js 15.3.5 + NextAuth v4.24.11
- Docker containers on localhost:8503 (HTTP)
- External Authentik OIDC at sso.irregularchat.com
- PrismaAdapter with PostgreSQL

## üõ†Ô∏è Everything We've Tried

### ‚úÖ Community Fixes Applied
Based on NextAuth GitHub Discussion #7491 and similar issues:

1. **Disabled Security Checks**: `checks: 'none'` to bypass PKCE/state validation
2. **Extended Cookie Lifetimes**: 24-hour maxAge for state and pkceCodeVerifier cookies  
3. **Redirect Callback**: Proper OAuth flow routing implementation
4. **Localhost Configuration**: All cookies set to `secure: false` for HTTP
5. **Timeout Increases**: Extended HTTP timeout to 10 seconds
6. **Fresh Environment**: Complete Docker rebuild with clean database

### üîß Technical Implementations
- Custom Authentik OAuth provider with explicit endpoints
- Comprehensive cookie configuration for localhost HTTP
- Detailed logging and debugging enabled
- PrismaAdapter with NextAuth required database tables
- Proper environment variable configuration

### üß™ Testing & Verification
- ‚úÖ OIDC well-known endpoint returns valid JSON configuration
- ‚úÖ Client credentials verified in Authentik admin panel
- ‚úÖ Redirect URI matches exactly in both systems
- ‚úÖ OAuth flow successfully redirects to and from Authentik
- ‚úÖ User authentication completes on Authentik
- ‚ùå **NextAuth callback fails with state mismatch**

## üéØ Current Error Analysis

**Exact Error**: 
```
OAuthCallbackError: state mismatch, expected undefined, got: 
```

**Error Location**: NextAuth callback processing after successful Authentik authentication

**Flow Status**:
1. ‚úÖ User clicks "Sign in with Authentik" 
2. ‚úÖ Redirects to Authentik OIDC provider
3. ‚úÖ User authenticates successfully
4. ‚ùå Callback to NextAuth fails with state mismatch
5. ‚ùå User remains on login page

## üìÅ Key Files & Configuration

### Files Involved
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - NextAuth configuration with all community fixes applied
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container environment with proper port mapping
- `GITHUB_ISSUE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_ERROR.md` - Comprehensive issue for community help

### Tech Stack
```json
{
  "next": "15.3.5",
  "next-auth": "^4.24.11",
  "@auth/prisma-adapter": "^2.10.0", 
  "react": "^19.0.0",
  "typescript": "^5"
}
```

## ü§ù Community Help Request

### What We Need
Since all standard fixes have been applied without success, we need:

1. **Advanced OAuth Debugging**: Techniques to inspect state/cookie handling in detail
2. **Edge Case Solutions**: Fixes for scenarios beyond typical community recommendations
3. **NextAuth v4 Expertise**: Known issues with v4.24.11 and external OIDC providers  
4. **Docker/Environment Insights**: Container-specific OAuth callback problems

### GitHub Issue Created
`GITHUB_ISSUE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_ERROR.md` contains a comprehensive issue ready for posting to:
- NextAuth.js GitHub repository
- Stack Overflow with appropriate tags
- Reddit r/nextjs community
- Discord/community forums

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Post GitHub Issue**: Submit comprehensive issue to NextAuth.js repository
2. **Community Engagement**: Share in relevant developer communities
3. **Advanced Debugging**: Implement any community-suggested debugging techniques
4. **Consider Alternatives**: Evaluate NextAuth v5 migration if v4 has known limitations

## üìä Success Metrics

**Goal**: Successful OAuth authentication flow where users can:
- Click "Sign in with Authentik"
- Complete authentication on external Authentik provider  
- Return to application with valid session
- Access protected application features

**Current Status**: 80% complete (OAuth flow works until NextAuth callback)

**Note**: This represents exhaustive troubleshooting of a complex OAuth integration. The issue appears to be an edge case that requires specialized community expertise beyond standard documentation and common fixes.
