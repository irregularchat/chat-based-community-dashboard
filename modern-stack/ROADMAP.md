- [ ] Unified messaging interface (Signal CLI + Matrix)
- [ ] Service abstraction layer for multi-platform support
- [ ] Configuration-aware feature availability
- [ ] Cross-platform user management

### 📋 Upcoming Features

#### v0.3.0 - Unified Community Management System
**🔧 ARCHITECTURAL REFACTOR: Matrix Management → Community Management**

##### Core Infrastructure Changes
- [ ] **Service Abstraction Layer**

- [ ] **Frontend Refactor**
  - [ ] Rename `/matrix` → `/community` route
  - [ ] Unified user interface for both Signal CLI and Matrix users
  - [ ] Platform-agnostic user selection and management
  - [ ] Dynamic feature availability based on configured services

##### Unified Operations Support
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Messaging**
