### üêõ Critical Issues Found (September 2025)

#### High Priority Fixes Required

1. **‚ùå !removeuser nonadmin Command Critical Bug**
   - **Issue**: Bot attempts to use non-existent `getGroup` API method
   - **Impact**: Command fails with "Could not retrieve member information"
   - **Fix**: Use `listGroups` method instead and properly parse admin data
   - **Status**: Fixed in code but needs testing
   - **Severity**: CRITICAL - Can remove admins instead of protecting them

2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Signal CLI Decryption Errors**
   - **Issue**: Multiple "invalid Whisper message: decryption failed" errors
   - **Impact**: Some messages may not be received properly
   - **Cause**: Missing sender key states and session issues
   - **Fix**: May need to refresh sessions or re-register with groups

3. **üî¥ News Scraping Failures**
   - **Issue**: WSJ, American Bar Association sites returning 401/403 errors
   - **Impact**: News summarization feature fails for paywalled content
   - **Workaround**: 12ft.io proxy also failing with ECONNREFUSED
   - **Fix**: Need better paywall bypass or user authentication

4. **üìä Prisma Database Validation Errors**
   - **Issue**: PrismaClientValidationError when tracking news links
   - **Impact**: News tracking feature may not persist data
   - **Fix**: Schema validation needed for news tracking

5. **üîë Signal UnidentifiedAccess NullPointerException**
   - **Issue**: "Cannot invoke UnidentifiedAccess.getUnidentifiedAccessKey()"
   - **Impact**: Some Signal operations may fail
   - **Fix**: Null checks needed in signal-cli operations

6. **üë§ Profile Retrieval Failures**
   - **Issue**: Hundreds of "Failed to retrieve profile: [404] Profile not found"
   - **Impact**: User profiles may not display correctly
   - **Fix**: Implement fallback for missing profiles

### üîß Immediate Action Items

1. **Test and verify !removeuser nonadmin fix**
   - Ensure admins are never removed
   - Add comprehensive logging
   - Create test suite for admin protection

2. **Implement Signal session refresh mechanism**
   - Auto-detect decryption failures
   - Refresh sender key states
   - Re-sync with problematic groups

3. **Enhance news scraping resilience**
   - Add more fallback scraping methods
   - Implement content caching
   - Handle paywalls gracefully

4. **Database schema updates**
   - Fix news tracking schema
   - Add proper constraints
   - Migration scripts needed

5. **Signal-CLI error handling**
