# Temporary Scripts and Data Files

This directory contains temporary files generated during the Signal bot restoration work:

## Directories:

- **user-restoration/**: Scripts for restoring removed users to Counter UXV group
- **testing/**: Test scripts for debugging and verification
- **data-files/**: JSON and text files with user data and results

## Important Notes:

- These files were part of debugging the accidental user removal incident
- Most are no longer needed but kept for reference
- The successful restoration approach is documented in LESSONS_LEARNED.md
- Signal bot is now operational with restored functionality
