### 📊 ROADMAP REALITY CHECK: What's Actually Built vs What We Thought

**🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**: The roadmap was significantly outdated. Signal CLI integration is NOT "upcoming" - it's production-complete with comprehensive dashboard integration.

#### ✅ **ALREADY COMPLETE** (Previously marked as "upcoming"):
1. **Signal CLI Dashboard Integration**: Fully implemented 5-tab admin interface
2. **User Management Workflows**: All CRUD operations functional (create, message, add, remove users)
3. **Database Schemas**: SignalGroupJoinRequest, SignalGroupMembership, SignalAvailableGroup all exist
4. **Community Management Interface**: Unified Signal users/groups management dashboard
5. **tRPC API Integration**: 904-line Signal router with 20+ procedures
6. **Group Management**: Join requests, approvals, member management all functional
7. **Real-time Health Monitoring**: Signal CLI daemon status and health checks
8. **Registration Workflow**: Complete phone verification with QR codes and device linking

#### 🎯 **ACTUAL NEXT PRIORITIES** (What we REALLY need):
1. **User-Facing Interfaces**: Transform admin-only tools into self-service user dashboards
2. **Welcome Automation**: Leverage existing bot to automate new member welcomes  
3. **User Invite System**: Allow users to generate/share Signal group invites
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Add "Signal Groups" tab to main user dashboard
5. **Rate Limiting & Security**: Add user-level protections to existing admin functions

#### v0.4.0 - Unified Community Management System
