   - [x] **Phase 3**: Safe execution (info commands only)
   - [x] **Phase 4**: Admin execution (with permission checks)
   - [ ] **Phase 5**: Learning and optimization

**Technical Architecture**:
```javascript
class AICommandAwareness {
  // Core components AI will access:
  commandRegistry: Map<string, CommandHandler>
  database: PrismaClient
  permissions: PermissionChecker
  executor: SafeCommandExecutor
  
  // AI capabilities:
  - List and explain all commands
  - Query database for context
  - Check user permissions
  - Execute appropriate commands
  - Learn from interactions
}
```

**Example Interactions**:
- **User**: "What events are coming up?"
  - **AI Action**: Query events DB → Format response → Send event list

- **User**: "Show me unanswered questions"
  - **AI Action**: Query Q&A DB → Filter pending → Display questions

- **User**: "Add me to developers group"
